Joining on entso because it only has 50 records
Task put different, we are trying to find the 50 records in entso in the gppd and platts datasets

Hints
    1) fuel_thesaurus is mapping of entso to gppd by fuel_type 
        - won't be 1-1 but will dramatically narrow potential joins
    2)  ‘wepp_id’  in gppd to 'plant_id' in platts
        - could use this mapping to chain entso << platts << gppd
    3) plant, country, fuel_type are strong keys
        - potential order funnel: country >> fuel_type >> plant name


Text processing
    - lowercase all
    - remove abbreviation from country '(XX)'
    - reprocess 'england & wales'

Join
    - join on country, fuel_type, plant name
    - could pick smallest text distance from plant name?
    



Shape of each dataset:
    entso: 50, 7
    platts: 68395, 13
    gppd: 29910, 11
